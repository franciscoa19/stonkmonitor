## What This Project Is

**StonkMonitor** — a real-time market signal monitor and semi-automated trader.
Two markets: traditional equities/options via **Alpaca** + prediction markets via **Kalshi**.

- Ingests Unusual Whales live feed (options flow, dark pool, insider, congress trades)
- Scores every event 1–10 and broadcasts to a Next.js dashboard via WebSocket
- Detects cross-feed patterns (e.g. sweep + dark pool + insider on same ticker)
- Auto-trade engine: signal ≥ 8.5 → Telegram card → one-tap Alpaca execution
- Kalshi scanner: surfaces prediction market opportunities → Telegram → one-tap buy
- Position monitor: watches Kalshi holdings, alerts at 3x/5x/10x gain with sell buttons
- Earnings scanner: Yang-Zhang IV/RV analysis identifies premium-selling setups

## Architecture: How Data Flows

```
Unusual Whales REST polling (session-aware, budget-gated):
    → process_uw_event()
        → db.save_*()                    (persist raw event)
        → manager.broadcast_feed()       (→ frontend raw feed)
        → engine.process_event()         (score 1-10)
            → handle_signal()
                → signal_store (ring buffer 500)
                → manager.broadcast_signal()   (→ frontend signal feed)
                → db.save_signal()             (if score >= 7)
                → discord/pushover alert       (if score >= threshold)
                → auto_trade.evaluate_signal() (if score >= 8.5)
                    → _queue() → DB + Telegram card + WS
        → pattern_engine.evaluate()     (cross-feed patterns)
            → auto_trade.evaluate_pattern()

Kalshi scan loop (every 5 min):
    → kalshi_client.get_markets()       (paginated, all categories)
    → kalshi_scanner.scan()             (6 opportunity types)
    → manager.broadcast(kalshi_scan)    (→ frontend Kalshi tab)
    → telegram.send_kalshi_alert()      (score >= 7, 1hr cooldown per ticker)
    → kalshi_arb_scanner.scan()         (monotonicity arb on threshold markets)
    → cross_arb_scanner.scan()          (Kalshi ↔ Polymarket arb via Dome)
    → manager.broadcast(kalshi_arb)     (→ frontend + Telegram if edge >= 3¢)

Kalshi position monitor (every 2 min):
    → kalshi_client.get_market(ticker)  (for each tracked position)
    → if gain >= 3x/5x/10x → telegram.send_kalshi_position_alert()

IV scanner loop (every 5 min RTH, 15 min extended, 30 min overnight, off weekends):
    → uw_client.get_iv_rank()           (UW IV rank)
    → engine.score_iv_rank()
    → earnings_scanner.scan_ticker()    (every 30 min, yfinance)
    → engine.score_earnings_setup()

Alpaca position monitor (every 2 min, RTH+extended only):
    → trader.get_positions()            (all open positions)
    → if pnl_pct >= +80% → sell 50% (TP1), activate trailing stop
    → trailing stop: track high watermark, sell remaining when pnl drops 20pp below peak
    → if pnl_pct <= -35% → sell 50% (trim), telegram.send_info()
    → if pnl_pct <= -40% → close_position (SL), telegram.send_info()
    → db.record_exit() on every TP/trail/trim/SL action

Performance sync (every 15 min):
    → trader.get_order_history()        (closed orders, last 90 days)
    → db.upsert_trade_performance()     (dedup by alpaca_order_id)

UW budget monitor (every 10 min):
    → budget.status()                   (daily count, limit, usage %, session)
    → manager.broadcast(uw_budget)      (→ frontend)
    → telegram.send_info()              (warns at 80% / 95%)
```

## Kalshi API — Critical Details

**Auth:** RSA-PSS signed requests — NO email/password.
- Sign message: `timestamp_ms + METHOD + /trade-api/v2/path` (strip query string before signing)
- Headers: `KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY`, `KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP`, `KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE`
- Library: `pycryptodome` (`from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA`)

**Base URLs:**
- Live: `https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2`
- Demo: `https://demo-api.kalshi.co/trade-api/v2`

**Correct endpoint:** `/events?status=open&with_nested_markets=true`
- Do NOT use `/markets` — returns wrong/empty data
- `get_markets()` paginates via `cursor` field until no more pages (up to 5000 markets)

**Real price field names (all dollars, 0.0–1.0):**
- `yes_ask_dollars`, `yes_bid_dollars`, `no_ask_dollars`, `no_bid_dollars`
- `volume_fp` (float), `last_price_dollars`, `previous_yes_ask_dollars`
- `liquidity_dollars` — always 0, useless, do not filter on it

**Order price:** cents integer (1–99) even though market data returns dollars.
- `place_order(price=92)` means 92¢ YES price
- For NO buys: API derives no_price = 100 - yes_price automatically

**Balance:** returned in cents — divide by 100 for dollars.

---

## Unusual Whales API — Critical Details

**Rate limit:** 3 concurrent requests + **15,000 requests/day** on Standard tier.
- Fixed concurrency by polling channels **sequentially** with 2s gaps (not `asyncio.gather`)
- `Retry-After` header respected on 429s
- `x-uw-daily-req-count` / `x-uw-token-req-limit` response headers tracked live by `feeds/uw_budget.py`

**Polling is session-aware — no longer a flat 15s round the clock.**
Per-channel intervals per session (see `SCHEDULE` in `feeds/uw_budget.py`):

| Session | options-flow | darkpool | insider-trades | congress-trades |
|---------|--------------|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| RTH (M–F 09:30–16:00 ET) | 15s | 15s | 60s | 60s |
| Extended (M–F 04:00–09:30 + 16:00–20:00) | 60s | 60s | 300s | 300s |
| Overnight (M–F 20:00–04:00) | **off** | **off** | 900s | 1800s |
| Weekend | **off** | **off** | 3600s | 3600s |

- **Throttle** at ≥80% daily: all intervals doubled
- **Pause** at ≥95% daily: `stream_flow()` idles 5 min; `_get()` hard-blocks stray callers
- `uw_budget_monitor_loop` logs + broadcasts every 10 min, Telegram warns at 80%/95%
- `GET /api/uw/budget` returns live snapshot
- Projected: ~5,300 calls/weekday, ~48 calls/weekend day (was ~11,250 flat)

---

## Kalshi Arb Scanners

**`signals/kalshi_arb.py` — Internal monotonicity arb**
- Groups markets by `event_ticker` → `(direction, normalized_title_prefix)` so Janet Mills never gets compared to Graham Platner
- Regex handles `above/at least/at or above/greater than/over/more than`, `below/under/less than/at or below`, `X or more/X+`, `before/by end of X`, `between $X and $Y`
- Spread guard: both legs must have spread < 10¢ and non-zero bids
- Conservative edge: `yb_hi - ya_lo` (sell rich @ bid, buy cheap @ ask); min 3¢
- Sum-violation check present but **DISABLED** — fires on non-MECE cumulative brackets
- Broadcasts `{type: "kalshi_arb"}`; Telegram warns when top edge ≥ 3¢

**`signals/kalshi_poly_arb.py` — Cross-platform Kalshi ↔ Polymarket arb**
- Requires `DOME_API_KEY`; silently disabled if blank
- Top 30 Kalshi markets by volume, 1-hour per-ticker match cache
- Similarity = (Jaccard ∪ SequenceMatcher on sorted keyword stream) / 2
- Threshold **0.70** (verified: Newsom 0.73 ✅, Bulgarian president 0.63 ❌)
- Two edge directions: `edge_a = kyb - pya` and `edge_b = pyb - kya`; surfaces with `match_confidence` + **both** full titles for operator verification
- Polymarket price semantics (critical): `/price?side=BUY` returns best **bid**, `/price?side=SELL` returns best **ask** (book-maker perspective). Verified against `/midpoint`. `feeds/polymarket.py` swaps the labels before returning.

Both run every Kalshi scan cycle and are silent most of the time — that's the correct steady state on efficient markets.

---

## Telegram Bot — Critical Details

**Bot:** configured via `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env`
**Chat ID:** stored in `.env` as `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` — auto-resolved on startup via `getUpdates` if not set

**Key methods:**
- `send_trade_alert(trade)` — Alpaca trade card with ✅ EXECUTE / ❌ SKIP
- `send_kalshi_alert(opp, alert_id)` — Kalshi buy card with ✅ EXECUTE / ❌ SKIP
- `send_kalshi_position_alert(...)` — Position spike card with ✅ SELL ALL / ✂️ SELL HALF / 🚫 HOLD
- `send_info(text)` — plain text, no buttons

**Critical bug fixed:** Telegram rejects `http://localhost:3000` as an inline button URL.
Never put localhost URLs in inline keyboards — the entire sendMessage fails silently.

**Callback routing in `_handle_update()`:**
- `confirm_{id}` → Alpaca execute
- `skip_{id}` → Alpaca skip
- `kalshi_exec_{id}` → Kalshi buy execute
- `kalshi_skip_{id}` → Kalshi buy skip
- `ksell_all_{id}` → Kalshi sell all
- `ksell_half_{id}` → Kalshi sell half
- `ksell_hold_{id}` → Kalshi hold (clear alert, keep tracking)

**Conflict:** Only ONE process can call `getUpdates` at a time. If backend is running,
don't run test scripts that also call getUpdates — you'll get a 409 conflict error.

## Kalshi Scanner — Strategy

Markets have 3M+ contracts — efficiently priced. We don't try to model probabilities.
Instead we **surface** interesting markets in 6 categories:

| Type | Criteria | Play |
|------|----------|------|
| `near_certain` | DTE ≤ 30, price ≤ 5¢ or ≥ 95¢ | Buy cheap side for lotto upside, OR buy expensive side for near-guaranteed yield |
| `yield_farm` | price 88–94.9¢, DTE ≤ 3d, annualized yield ≥ 100% | Short-dated almost-certain contracts with triple-digit annualized return |
| `smart_money` | volume Z-score ≥ 2.5 vs 20-scan rolling mean + price move ≥ 3¢ | Unusual size hitting against a visible price move |
| `high_vol_extreme` | vol > 100k, price ≤ 8¢ or ≥ 92¢ | Crowd has decided — fade or follow |
| `mover` | price_move ≥ 8¢, vol > 10k | Momentum or mean-reversion |
| `active` | vol > 500k, price 30–70¢ | Active debate — take a side |

**Score formula:** extremeness × volume × time-urgency + type bonus
**Alerts:** score ≥ 7, 1-hour cooldown per ticker, max 1 per scan cycle

**Maker pricing:** For each opportunity the scanner also computes a `maker_price` (limit at bid-side so you earn the spread instead of crossing it). Telegram card shows both ask and maker; execution uses `maker_cents`. Per-ticker volume rolling window: `_volume_history: dict[str, deque]` with `VOL_HIST_LEN=20`.

**Position tracking:** When user taps Execute on Telegram:
- `_kalshi_positions[ticker]` stores entry_cents, contracts, side
- Monitor checks `yes_bid_dollars` every 2 min
- Alerts at 3x, 5x, 10x gain — each threshold fires once (won't re-fire same threshold)

---

## Earnings Scanner — Strategy

Adapted from `C:\Users\franc\OneDrive\Documents\trade calculator\calculator.py`

**Three conditions for a sell-premium setup:**
1. `avg_volume >= 1,500,000` — liquidity
2. `iv30_rv30 >= 1.25` — options priced 25%+ above Yang-Zhang realized vol
3. `ts_slope_0_45 <= -0.00406` — term structure inverted (front-month IV spike = earnings)

**Yang-Zhang HV** is better than close-to-close because it uses OHLC data and
correctly handles overnight gaps. The original calculator used it; we kept it verbatim.

**When it fires:** Add tickers to watchlist → scanner runs every 30 min → fires
`earnings_setup` signal (🎯 in feed) with IV30%, RV30%, IV/RV ratio, expected move.

**Play:** Sell ATM straddle before earnings, collect IV crush. Expected move = straddle price ÷ stock price.

---

## Auto-Trade Engine (Alpaca)

**Triggers:** signal score ≥ 8.5 OR pattern score ≥ 9.0

**Options flow:** Builds OCC symbol, fetches live bid/ask from Alpaca data API
(`/v1beta1/options/snapshots`), sizes to min(2% equity, $2,500 cap).

**OCC symbol format:** `TICKER YYMMDD C/P STRIKE*1000 (8-digit zero-padded)`
Example: `SNDK260424C00840000`

**DTE guard:** rejects < 2d or > 21d expiries.

**Equity trades:** insider_buy / congress_trade → market buy, sized to min(2% equity, $2,500).

**Bracket orders:** Every new trade is submitted as an `OrderClass.BRACKET` with server-side
TP (limit) and SL (stop) legs attached to the entry. Prices computed from `TradeSuggestion.target_pct`
and `stop_pct` (options: +80%/-40%, equity: +15%/-5%). If bracket submission fails (e.g. some
options contracts), falls back to a plain limit order. Telegram confirmation shows TP/SL prices.

**Expiry:** pending trades expire after 5 minutes if not confirmed.

---

## Patterns Engine (9 patterns)

| Pattern | Score | Trigger |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `triple_confluence` | 10.0 | Sweep + dark pool + insider aligned |
| `insider_buy_plus_sweep` | 9.5 | CEO open-market buy + bullish sweep |
| `sweep_plus_darkpool` | 9.0 | Institutions in options AND shares |
| `golden_sweep_cluster` | 9.0 | 2+ golden sweeps same ticker in 3d |
| `insider_cluster_buy` | 9.0 | 3+ insiders buying within 30d |
| `congress_plus_sweep` | 8.5 | Congress buy + unusual sweep |
| `size_sweep` | 8.5 | Single sweep > $1M |
| `congress_plus_darkpool` | 8.0 | Congress buy + dark pool accumulation |
| `size_darkpool` | 8.0 | Single dark pool print > $10M |

---

## Database Schema

```sql
signals            -- scored signals (score >= 7 persisted)
options_flow       -- raw UW options flow events
dark_pool_prints   -- raw UW dark pool events
insider_trades     -- raw UW insider trade events
congress_trades    -- raw UW congress trade events
pending_trades     -- Alpaca auto-trade queue (status: pending/confirmed/skipped/expired/failed)
trade_performance  -- closed/open Alpaca orders + exit reason/P&L (synced every 15 min)
watchlist          -- tickers for IV + earnings scanning
```

---

## Dashboard Tabs

| Tab | Content |
|-----|---------|
| 📡 Watch | Live signal feed — filter by type, min score slider |
| 🗄️ History | Persisted signals from DB, ticker leaderboard |
| 🎯 Patterns | Pattern hits with evidence |
| 💹 Trade | Alpaca trade queue (countdown timers) + positions |
| 🎰 Kalshi | Live opportunity scanner with execute buttons |

**Earnings filter** in the signal feed filters to `earnings_setup` signals only.

---

## Known Issues / Past Bugs Fixed

1. **UW 429 rate limit** — was using `asyncio.gather` (concurrent). Fixed: sequential 2s gaps.
2. **Kalshi wrong endpoint** — `/markets` returns bad data. Must use `/events?with_nested_markets=true`.
3. **Kalshi `status=active`** — returns 400. Use `status=open`.
4. **Kalshi liquidity_dollars** — always 0 in API. Don't filter on it.
5. **Telegram localhost URL** — `http://localhost:3000` in inline buttons causes silent sendMessage failure. Never do this.
6. **Telegram getUpdates conflict** — only one process can long-poll at a time. Stop backend before running test scripts.
7. **Kalshi scanner finding 0 opps** — original approach tried to model probability edge. Markets with 3M+ contracts are efficiently priced. Switched to surfacer strategy.
8. **Kalshi arb 126 false positives** — sum_violation was firing on non-MECE cumulative brackets (e.g. "retire before 2027/28/29"). Fix: disabled sum_violation, added `_normalize_prefix` grouping so only markets with identical prefix after number-stripping get compared.
9. **Polymarket bid/ask reversed** — `/price?side=BUY` returns best *bid*, `/price?side=SELL` returns best *ask* (book-maker perspective). Verified against `/midpoint`. `feeds/polymarket.py` swaps labels.
10. **UW API at 75% daily burn** — was polling all 4 channels every 15s round the clock. Fix: session-aware per-channel schedule in `feeds/uw_budget.py` (options/darkpool off overnight + weekends; insider/congress stretched; throttle at 80%, pause at 95%). Weekday burn: 11,250 → ~5,300.

## Recent Work

- ✅ Kalshi scanner rewritten as opportunity surfacer (expanded to 6 types — added `yield_farm`, `smart_money`)
- ✅ Maker pricing on Kalshi execute cards (earn the spread, not pay it)
- ✅ Kalshi internal monotonicity arb (`signals/kalshi_arb.py`) with normalized-prefix grouping
- ✅ Cross-platform Kalshi ↔ Polymarket arb (`signals/kalshi_poly_arb.py`) via Dome API + public Polymarket CLOB
- ✅ Similarity scoring combines Jaccard + SequenceMatcher, threshold 0.70
- ✅ **UW API budget governor** — `feeds/uw_budget.py` tracks daily call count via response headers, enforces session-aware per-channel polling cadence, auto-throttles at 80%, auto-pauses at 95%, Telegram warns, `/api/uw/budget` endpoint
- ✅ IV scanner skips weekends, slows in extended/overnight sessions
- ✅ Kalshi Telegram alerts with Execute/Skip buttons (fixed localhost URL bug)
- ✅ Position monitor — tracks buys, alerts at 3x/5x/10x for exits
- ✅ Full market pagination — scans all categories (was capped at 200)
- ✅ Earnings scanner integrated from trade calculator (Yang-Zhang, IV/RV, term structure)
- ✅ KalshiPanel frontend tab with live WS updates and filter chips
- ✅ **Alpaca position monitor (TP/SL/trim)** — `alpaca_position_monitor()` background loop checks positions every 2 min during RTH+extended. TP at +80% (sell 50%), trim at -20% (sell 50%), SL at -40% (liquidate). Auto-executes market orders, Telegram confirms after. All thresholds configurable via `.env`.
- ✅ **Windows auto-start service** — `start_service.bat` restart loop + `StonkMonitor.vbs` in Startup folder. Backend survives reboots and crashes.
- ✅ **Alpaca bracket orders** — new trades submitted as `OrderClass.BRACKET` with server-side TP limit + SL stop. Options: +80%/-40%, equity: +15%/-5%. Falls back to plain limit if bracket not supported. Telegram confirmation shows TP/SL prices.
- ✅ **Ratcheting trailing stop** — after TP1 sells half, remaining position tracked with high-watermark trailing stop (default 20pp below peak, floor at 60% gain minimum). Replaces fixed T2. Configurable via `POS_TRAIL_AFTER_TP` and `POS_TRAIL_PCT`.
- ✅ **Performance tracking** — `trade_performance` table syncs Alpaca closed orders every 15 min. Position monitor records exit reason (tp1/trailing_stop/sl/trim) and realized P&L. API endpoints: `/api/performance`, `/api/performance/summary` (win rate, profit factor, avg win/loss).

---

## TODOs / Next Ideas

- Kalshi position tracking survives restarts (currently in-memory, lost on restart)
- More earnings scanner signal detail in dashboard (show pass/fail table inline)
- Options chain viewer for earnings_setup signals (show the actual straddle to sell)
- Backtest mode for earnings scanner signals
- Auto-execute Kalshi buys without confirmation (optional, flag in .env)
